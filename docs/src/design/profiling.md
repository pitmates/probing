# Profiling Architecture

Performance analysis is first a cost-allocation problem. Long-running observation requires low,
predictable overhead and stable coordinates; deep diagnosis needs dense operator, kernel, and
stack events. A single collector cannot optimize for both. Probing therefore separates continuous
observation from short-window drill-down and composes their evidence at query time.

## System decomposition

![Independent collectors write local tables](../assets/architecture/probing-collector-landscape.svg)

Collection runs inside the process that owns the data because module hooks, communication
callbacks, and runtime stacks are cheapest to observe there. Each collector owns only its state
and local tables; collectors do not call one another on hot paths. Version skew, contention, or a
failure in one collector therefore does not spread into the training path or another collector.

Independence creates a correlation problem. Probing solves it without a synchronous event bus:
facts carry step, rank, time, and parallel-role coordinates, and the query engine reconstructs
context across tables and ranks. Coordination cost moves from collection time to query time. This
decision is what allows Torch, NCCL, HCCL, stack, and system collectors to evolve independently.

## Two observation levels for PyTorch

TorchProbe and Torch Profiler coexist because observation depth and sustainable cost conflict.
TorchProbe remains active through training and retains step, module, optimizer, and memory facts.
It gives up operator detail so its cost can be sampled, measured, and sustained. Torch Profiler
uses Kineto over a known anomalous window to collect CPU op, CUDA kernel, runtime, and memcpy
events. It yields deeper evidence, but is not a continuous telemetry path.

The paths have incompatible lifetimes, buffers, and failure boundaries, so they are not merged
into one state machine. They meet only through shared step/rank coordinates in SQL. The resulting
diagnostic progression is deliberate: continuous data narrows the search to a rank, step, and
module; a targeted capture then pays for operator and kernel detail. If both run together their
costs add, and TorchProbe shadow measurements must not be interpreted as Kineto overhead.

### Torch Profiler as a bounded capture transaction

![On-demand Torch Profiler control, finalization, SQL views, and timeline output](../assets/architecture/probing-torch-profiler-integration.svg)

`ProfilerController` permits one capture at a time because Kineto owns process-wide state.
Concurrent sessions would make event ownership, stop, and cleanup ambiguous. The capture advances
at optimizer-step boundaries so windows across ranks can be aligned by training coordinates rather
than by the instant at which a control request arrived.

Aggregation and format conversion happen only after the window closes. This keeps
`key_averages()`, raw-event traversal, and JSON generation off the training hot path. Finalization
prefers op/kernel aggregates; when aggregation is unavailable it preserves a bounded raw-event
fallback and records `truncated` explicitly instead of presenting partial data as complete.

One capture produces several representations because machine analysis and human inspection need
different shapes. `python.profile_capture` and `python.profile_hotspot` are virtual tables over a
bounded session store, suitable for filtering, aggregation, and cross-rank comparison through
`global.python.profile_hotspot`. The complete `traceEvents` structure remains a timeline for the
Web UI. It is not expanded into MEMT rows: copying every event would amplify hot-path writes, while
capture lifetime is fundamentally different from continuous telemetry.

A capture may select roofline as a short-window analysis feature, for example
`GET /apis/pythonext/pytorch/profile/start?steps=1&analysis=roofline`. Such a capture also
reads raw `profiler.events()` during finalize and derives `python.profile_counter` (kernel-level
CUPTI counter facts) and `python.profile_roofline` (operator/kernel roofline conclusions). This
path is deliberately separate from `key_averages()`: counters and operator association require
raw event args and are materialized once at capture close. The analysis feature belongs to the
capture rather than to `PROBING_TORCH_PROFILING`, so enabling continuous TorchProbe sampling
never implicitly enables high-overhead CUPTI counters; future capture analyses can share the
same `analysis` parameter instead of growing one process-global flag per tool. The full design
is in [Operator Roofline](roofline.md).
For parity, a roofline capture also exports the same Kineto session to Chrome trace format once
after online compilation. Offline parsing and `profiler.events()` compilation must produce the
same counter facts, operator association, and roofline values; this trace is retained with the
bounded capture only for diagnostics and does not add a hot-path write.

### TorchProbe as a long-running step state machine

![TorchProbe step state and async queues](../assets/architecture/probing-torchprobe-state.svg)

Optimizer hooks define step boundaries, while module hooks record facts within the current step.
The main thread advances the state machine, evaluates sampling gates, and records bounded events;
CUDA elapsed-time reads and batch preparation move to a deferred queue. Step wall time is fixed
before old events are drained, so drain cost is not charged to the step that just ended.

Hook selection follows a minimum-intrusion rule. Forward timing uses module pre/post hooks.
Backward timing avoids module backward hooks, which interact poorly with inplace activations, and
instead registers tensor grad hooks on forward inputs and outputs. The interval from grad-output
ready to grad-input ready approximates the module backward window; when both boundaries cannot be
formed, the system does not claim a precise duration.

Sampling has two stages because step density and per-step coverage are independent cost controls.
The step gate is a deterministic, evenly spaced function of the step number, so every rank selects
the same steps. Within a sampled step, a deterministic hash of `(step, layer)` selects modules.
The default `rate=0.05`, `layer_rate=1.0` retains full module relationships for a small fraction of
steps. Unsampled steps short-circuit at hook entry but still write step wall time, preserving a
continuous trend.

Shadow steps are interleaved at `4:1` by default and bypass TorchProbe hooks. This places the
baseline inside the same training run and workload, reducing environment drift from offline A/B
measurement. The consequence is equally important: it measures only the TorchProbe path. Timing
boundaries, statistical semantics, and confidence gates are defined in the
[overhead model](overhead.md).

The continuous path publishes two stable contracts: `python.torch_trace` for module facts and
`python.torch_step_timing` for step class and wall time. Column definitions belong in the
[SQL table reference](../reference/sql-tables.md#python-torch_trace); distributed timeline
construction over these local facts is described in
[Distributed Profiler query and visualization](distributed-profiler.md).

## Megatron coordinate integration

![Megatron import hooks align parallel roles and iterations with Probing coordinates](../assets/architecture/probing-megatron-integration.svg)

The Megatron adapter is a coordinate bridge, not another collector. Import hooks watch
`megatron.core.parallel_state` and `megatron.training.training`. Once their APIs are available,
the adapter reads TP/PP/DP/EP/CP ranks into `probing.set_role(...)` and wraps `train_step` on a
best-effort basis to align Megatron's iteration and micro-batch count with `probing.step(...)`.

This boundary keeps version-sensitive Megatron getters in one adapter. TorchProbe, collective,
stack, profiler, and system collectors continue to depend only on the common step/role state and
join through SQL. Missing modules or an incompatible Megatron API degrade without blocking the
training loop. Runtime controls are documented under
[Megatron autostart](../reference/env-vars.md#megatron-autostart).

## HCCL collection through the MSProf boundary

![HCCL MSProf shim records local tables and forwards the original calls to CANN](../assets/architecture/probing-hccl-collector.svg)

On Ascend, HCCL already reports profiling events through `libprofapi.so`. Probing places an
ABI-compatible shim at that boundary: it exports the expected MSProf symbols, classifies and
decodes `ReportApi`, `ReportCompactInfo`, and `ReportAdditionalInfo` payloads, appends rows to
`hccl.host_ops`, `hccl.collectives`, `hccl.tasks`, `hccl.mc2_streams`, and
`hccl.context_ids`, then forwards the original arguments and return value to the real CANN
library.

The real library is resolved from `PROBING_HCCL_PROFAPI_REAL`, a sibling
`libprofapi.so.real`, or the configured Ascend installation. A table-open failure disables only
that table; it does not disable forwarding. Because MSProf structure layouts follow the deployed
CANN version, installation must preserve the matching real library and validate the ABI. The
shim never resolves bare `libprofapi.so`, which would recursively load itself.

## Tracing and training phases {#tracing-training-phases}

Tracing owns the coarse training timeline; TorchProbe owns module timing and memory facts. They may
correlate on a step, but must not both own forward/backward/optimizer phase spans.

### State ownership and persistence {#span-api}

![The span stack owns phase state while the Recorder only commits to backends](../assets/architecture/probing-span-persistence.svg)

The span stack is the sole owner of phase state; persistence is only an output. `probing.span`
creates a nested scope, `probing.event` marks the current scope, and `record_span` submits an
already-closed interval. All three converge on `SpanRecorder`, keeping memtable, logger, and OTEL
as sinks that cannot feed state back into phase tracking.

`probing.span` uses deferred close. A span without events becomes one closed interval on exit; the
first event causes a lazy `span_start`, followed by `span_end` on exit. This reduces write
amplification for quiet scopes. The tradeoff is explicit: an active span without events is not yet
visible to SQL. That is commit semantics, not missing data.

### Training-phase invariants {#training-phase-semantics}

Training has no second global phase variable. `phase` is always the innermost `forward`,
`backward`, or `optimizer` span; an empty training stack means `idle`. `train.step` is the closed
interval for one logical iteration, not a fourth phase. Optimizer exit advances `micro_step`, and
`micro_batches` then maps it to `local_step`, so gradient accumulation does not create false
complete steps.

The resulting invariants are:

1. phase state comes from the span stack, not a second global variable;
2. `train.step` starts at the first forward and ends at optimizer exit across gradient accumulation;
3. an optimizer exit writes at most one `train.step`, and only after a forward;
4. manual spans, phase hooks, and TorchProbe never duplicate an already-active phase;
5. with `micro_batches=k`, each k micro steps advance one `local_step`.

Phase ownership belongs to `attach_training_phases`: it closes forward/backward/optimizer and
submits `train.step` wall time. TorchProbe detects an existing owner and does not duplicate phase
spans; it publishes only module timing and memory facts. This ownership rule prevents two hook
systems from assigning different meanings to the same training interval.

`probing.tracing.SPANS_SQL` joins start/end rows into `duration_us` for querying. See
[Core model](../guide/concepts.md) and [Environment variables](../reference/env-vars.md#tracing-spans).

## Python Stack Profiling

The stack path is divided into `StackSnapshot → ParsedStacks → FoldedStacks` because asynchronous
signal context cannot allocate, symbolize, or take complex locks. Capture writes only thread/source
flags, native PCs, and pre-interned Python frame keys into fixed storage. Parse reconstructs symbols
and mixed stacks outside signal context; fold then performs fingerprint aggregation and flamegraph
output. On-demand capture and continuous sampling can share the latter stages without coupling their
trigger mechanisms to interpretation.

The eval-frame VM tracer is the only source of Python frames. It interns symbols while holding the
GIL, leaving the signal path to copy keys. On Linux, native frames are filled in place by
`SIGPROF`/`SIGUSR2` handlers running on alternate stacks. On macOS, asynchronous SIGPROF can land in
system SIMD routines and cause `SIGILL`, so the default is cooperative, rate-limited Python capture
from eval-frame. When an on-demand native stack is required, Mach briefly suspends the target,
copies the PC/frame-pointer chain, resumes it immediately, and symbolizes later. Platform-specific
behavior is therefore confined to capture; parse, merge, and fold stay common.

Continuous sampling uses a bounded ring and two publication buffers. Contention drops and counts a
snapshot instead of blocking the training thread. Query and Web paths reuse the latest snapshot
rather than signaling a main thread that is already being sampled. Across ranks, each process folds
duplicate paths before transfer; the coordinator merges equal paths and records rank coverage. This
changes network cost from proportional to raw samples to proportional to distinct call paths, while
still allowing a partial, explicitly incomplete result when some ranks fail.

TorchProbe module flamegraphs use the same distributed aggregation idea but retain independent
collection state. Module timing and mixed CPU stacks meet only in the query and presentation layers.

## Boundary with the other layers

System metrics are periodic; Torch, communication, and stack collectors are event-driven. They
share coordinates but not scheduler threads. Long-running facts enter columnar probe tables, while
retention, hot/cold placement, and cross-rank querying belong to the data and query layers. A
collector does not grow a second storage policy. See the [table reference](../reference/sql-tables.md)
and [SQL analytics guide](../guide/sql-analytics.md) for fields and examples, and the
[overhead model](overhead.md) for measurement semantics and invariants.
